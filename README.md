# scala-tree
A recursive implementation of an N-ary tree, in Scala

The interesting files are [Tree.scala](https://github.com/mbren/scala-tree/blob/master/src/main/scala/Tree.scala), which contains the implementation and [TreeSpec.scala](https://github.com/mbren/scala-tree/blob/master/src/test/scala/TreeSpec.scala), which contains the tests. The other files are just Scala project scaffolding.
